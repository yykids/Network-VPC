## Network > VPC > Console Guide

This document describes what is required to deal with VPCs in the console.

## VPC

AS a VPC may have many subnets, a sufficiently large network must be configured when divided subnets are used. VPC network can be described by using [CIDR Notation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Classless_Inter-Domain_Routing).  All VPCs must be located in the three address areas as below, to be able to configure a [Private Network](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Private_network) and link-local addresses cannot be used. Furthermore, the network area must be larger than 24bit-256 at the least. 

### Private Network 

RFC1918 | IP Address Area | Available Number of Addresses 
-------- | ---------- | -----------------
24bit block | 10.0.0.0/8 | 16,777,216
20bit block | 172.16.0.0/12 | 1,047,576
16bit block | 192.168.0.0/16 | 65,536

### Link-Local Addresses 

Cannot use 65,536 IP addresses that are included to 169.254.0.0/16. 

### Examples 

Example | Availability 
-------- | ---------- 
10.0.0.0/8 | Available. 
10.0.0.0/16 | Available. 
10.0.0.0/24 | Available. 
10.0.0.0/28 | Unavailable. Range is too short. 
172.16.0.0/16 | Available. 
172.16.0.0/8 | Unavailable. Out of available range. 
192.168.0.0/16 | Available. Specified as default range. 
192.168.0.0/24 | Available. 
192.253.0.0/24 | Unavailable. Out of available range. 

<br>


By using initial compute and network products, items as below are to be automatically configured. 

Item | Name | Summary 
-------- | ---------- | --------------
VPC | Default Network | Creates one VPC within the range of 192.168.0.0/16. 
Subnet | Default Network | Creates one subnet within the range of 192.168.0.0/24. 
Routing Table | vpc-[id] | Creates one routing table named after a part of VPC ID. 
Internet Gateway | ig-[id] | Creates one internet gateway named after a part of routing table ID. 
Security Group | default | Creates a security group named default. 

To add VPC, not as an initial configuration, configure items as below: 

Item | Name | Summary 
-------- | ---------- | --------------
VPC | As specified | Creates one VPC within the specified range. 
Subnet | - | Not created. 
Routing Table | vpc-[id] | Creates one routing table named after a part of VPC ID. 
Internet Gateway | - | Not created: create additionally and connect. 
Security Group | - | Not created additionally. 

Here is the quota for VPC and each item.  

Item | Max 
-------- | ---------- 
VPC | 3
Subnet | 10 per VPC 
Internet Gateway | 3 
Floating IP | Unlimited 
Routing Table | 10 per VPC 
Route | 10 per Routing Table 
Peering | Unlimited 
NAT gateway | Unlimited



> [Note]
VPCs can be deleted only when subnets are deleted altogether, and in such case, delete along with subnets, routing tables, and internet gateways. 

* VPC is safe from traffic as it is completed isolated from other VPCs .

* Direct access of VPC from the internet is unavailable as it is a private network.  

* All elements within VPC cannot use VLAN. 

* For those traffic beyond  a region, local communication is not provided.  

* All instances within a VPC cannot access the internet without internet gateway. 

* Excessively transferred "Broadcast, Multicast, Unknown Unicast" may be blocked without prior notice. 


## Subnets 

A  VPC can be subdivided into subnets that are composed of many networks. However, a subnet must be included within the range of a VPC address, with its length the same or shorter.  For example, in the case of 192.168.0.0/16, a total of 65536 IP addresses are available between 192.168.0.0 and 192.168.255.255. In addition, the smallest subnet is 28 bits and any configuration cannot be smaller than that. Subnets also adopt CIDR display, just like VPC.  

When a subnet is created, its gateway IP address is automatically designated and it cannot be modified. It is also automatically registered to a routing table included to the VPC. 

> [Note]
To delete a subnet, it should be empty with no instances or load balancers included. Also, make sure that the routing table which the subnet is connected to does not have  routes to that subnet.

* Assigns one IP address to a newly-created instance from a designated subnet (called a fixed IP).

* Applies the IP address to the instance when it is booted, via DHCP.  

* Cannot modify the address range of a subnet. 

* Cannot redundantly create or overlap the range for different subnets within a same VPC.

* The range of subnets may be redundant or wrapped over for different VPCs. 

* MAC addresses that are not assigned to an instance may be blocked from the network; VPN service running on instances may not operate. 

* When many subnets are connected to an instance, an appropriate routing setting is required within OS of the instance. 

* Two subnets within a same VPC are not completely isolated; apply security groups to protect instances. 

* Subnets support local communication through different areas of availability. Local communication shall not be charged.  


## Internet Gateway

An internet gateway can be connected to a routing table. VPCs comprised of private networks cannot be connected externally, and may access the internet through internet gateway. Each instance, to be connected to an internet, must set "default gateway" as the gateway address of the subnet, and TOAST does the job automatically. To create an internet gateway, an external network is required and TOAST is operating only one "public_network" as of now.  

* An internet gateway address is automatically assigned when an instance is created or VPC requires an internet access, and it cannot be modified. 

* Cannot access an instance with an internet gateway address. 

* Blocks all traffic inflow via internet gateway address.

* Charges by usage, when an instance connected to the internet triggers traffic to the internet direction.

* Do not charge for local communication between instances. 

### Guide for Restarting Internet Gateways for Server Maintenance 

TOAST updates software of the Internet gateway server on a regular basis to enhance security and stability of its infrastructure services. 

Internet gateways that are running on a target server for maintenance must be restarted and migrated to the server which is completed with maintenance.  

To restart Internet gateways, use the **! Restart** button which is created next to each Internet gateway name. 

Go to the project where your Internet gateway specified as maintenance target is located. 

1. Any Internet gateway that has the **! Restart** button before its name requires maintenance. 
    ![ig-001](http://static.toastoven.net/prod_vpc/ConsoleGuide/ig_planned_migration_guide-en-001.png)
    Put the mouse cursor on the **! Restart** button to find maintenance schedule details. 
    ![ig-002](http://static.toastoven.net/prod_vpc/ConsoleGuide/ig_planned_migration_guide-en-002.png)

2. Select a target Internet gateway and click the **! Restart** button next to its name. 
    It is advised to perform maintenance during time when impact on service is limited, since instances of the Internet gateway are disconnected from the Internet until restarting is completed. 
    However, instances that are connected to floating IPs are not influenced by restarting of Internet gateways. 

3. Click **OK** onto the window asking of restarting Internet gateway. 
    ![ig-003](http://static.toastoven.net/prod_vpc/ConsoleGuide/ig_planned_migration_guide-en-003.png)

4. Wait until the Internet gateway status turns green and the **! Restart** button disappears.
    If the status does not change or the **! Restart** button remains, press 'Refresh'.  
    ![ig-004](http://static.toastoven.net/prod_vpc/ConsoleGuide/ig_planned_migration_guide-en-004.png)

The Internet gateway becomes inoperable while restarting is underway.
Unless restarting Internet gateway is normally completed, it shall be automatically reported to the administrator, and you'll be contacted by TOAST.  

## NAT gateway
This feature is available only in the Pyeongchon region, Korea.
NAT gateway can be set as a gateway from the route setting of a routing table. If NAT gateway is set as the gateway for the routing table, the floating IP of NAT gateway can be switched to source IP to access the Internet.

| Item      | Description                                                         |
| --------|------------------------------------------------------------ |
| Name      | Can specify the name of NAT gateway. |
| VPC      | Specifies the VPC to create NAT gateway. |
| Subnet     | Specifies the subnets connected to a routing table that is connected to the Internet gateway among the subnets of the selected VPC. NAT gateway cannot be created with a subnet that does not satisfy the conditions. |
| Floating IP  | Specifies the floating IP to be assigned to NAT gateway. This IP is converted to the source IP when connecting to the Internet. |
| Description      | Can add the description for NAT gateway. |

* The VPC, subnet, and floating IP of an NAT gateway cannot be changed.

* The floating IP configured by NAT gateway cannot be disconnected. It is automatically disconnected when the NAT gateway is deleted.

* Instances cannot be accessed with the NAT gateway address.

* The inbound traffic to the NAT gateway address is entirely blocked.

* A single NAT gateway can be specified as a gateway in multiple routing tables in the same VPC.

* Subnets specified when NAT gateway is configured and routing tables connected to a different subnet can specify NAT gateway as its gateway.

* Network ACL is applied.


## Floating IP 

When an instance is created, an IP address is assigned from a designated subnet. The IP address is certainly included to VPC, as it is the subnet address, and we call it Fixed IP. As it is a private network address, an access from the internet is not available. Therefore, to access the internet directly from outside, an accessible IP address from outside is required. Floating IP allows direct access to an instance from the internet, by linking the address to the instance 1:1. For more details, refer to [Overview]. To create a floating IP, an external network must be selected and TOAST currently operates only one "public network".   

> [Note] To connect a floating IP to an instance, a subnet including the instance must be connected to a routing table,  <br>
> and the routing table must be connected to the internet through an internet gateway, so as to perform "connection". 

* Charges for a floating IP begin from the moment it is created, and charging shall continue before it is deleted (which is irrelevant to instance connection).  

* A connection to a floating IP does not mean a change of a fixed IP to a floating IP. 

* Traffic occurred to the internet direction shall be charged. 

* Two instances, within a same VPC, communicating via floating IP shall be charged by the usage.  

> [Note] Two instances, within a same VPC, communicating locally via fixed IP shall not be charged. 

### Associating Floating IP to Instances with Many Network Interfaces 

An instance with a multiple number of network interfaces can have each of its network interface associated with floating IP. However, in order to access the instance with a floating IP which is associated to other network interfaces, except the first one, the routing rule setting must be set for the instance.  

 An instance which is created with **`Dec.27,2018` or later version of TOAST Common Linux Image Deployment ** can be accessed via all floating IPs associated with each network interface, by configuring the auto routing rule for a booting. 

*Access an instance, and check if routing rule is set, as below: 
```
$ ip rule
0:      from all lookup local
100:    from { IP address of eth0 } lookup 1
200:    from { IP address of eth1 } lookup 2
300:    from { IP address of eth2 } lookup 3
...
32766:  from all lookup main
32767:  from all lookup default
```
When the `ip rule` command is executed and the routing rule is set for each network interface, then you can access instance via all floating IPs. 

An instance that is created by other images can be accessed via all floating IPs associated with the instance, by setting the routing rule within instance, as below: 

Access instance via floating IP which is associated to the first network interface (eth0), and execute the commands as below to other network interfaces trying to access via the floating IP. 
```
ip rule add from {IP address for network interface}/32 table {table number} priority {priority}
ip route add default via {default gateway address for network interface} table {table number}
ip route add {Subnet CIDR of network interface} dev {name of network interface} table {table number}
```

For instance, if an instance has the following network interface information
```
1: lo: <LOOPBACK,UP,LOWER_UP> mtu 65536 qdisc noqueue state UNKNOWN
    link/loopback 00:00:00:00:00:00 brd 00:00:00:00:00:00
    inet 127.0.0.1/8 scope host lo
       valid_lft forever preferred_lft forever
    inet6 ::1/128 scope host
       valid_lft forever preferred_lft forever
2: eth0: <BROADCAST,MULTICAST,UP,LOWER_UP> mtu 1454 qdisc pfifo_fast state UP qlen 1000
    link/ether fa:16:3e:8d:71:d6 brd ff:ff:ff:ff:ff:ff
    inet 192.168.100.132/24 brd 192.168.100.255 scope global dynamic eth0
       valid_lft 86379sec preferred_lft 86379sec
    inet6 fe80::f816:3eff:fe8d:71d6/64 scope link
       valid_lft forever preferred_lft forever
3: eth1: <BROADCAST,MULTICAST,UP,LOWER_UP> mtu 1454 qdisc pfifo_fast state UP qlen 1000
    link/ether fa:16:3e:06:96:2f brd ff:ff:ff:ff:ff:ff
    inet 172.16.0.37/24 brd 172.16.0.255 scope global dynamic eth1
       valid_lft 86381sec preferred_lft 86381sec
    inet6 fe80::f816:3eff:fe06:962f/64 scope link
       valid_lft forever preferred_lft forever
4: eth2: <BROADCAST,MULTICAST,UP,LOWER_UP> mtu 1454 qdisc pfifo_fast state UP qlen 1000
    link/ether fa:16:3e:06:ac:10 brd ff:ff:ff:ff:ff:ff
    inet 10.254.0.90/24 brd 10.254.0.255 scope global dynamic eth2
       valid_lft 86386sec preferred_lft 86386sec
    inet6 fe80::f816:3eff:fe06:ac10/64 scope link
       valid_lft forever preferred_lft forever
```
To access `eth1`, `eth2` via floating IP, set routing rule with the following commands 

```
# Setting Routing Rule to Access eth1 with Floating IP 
ip rule add from 172.16.0.37/32 table 2 priority 200
ip route add default via 172.16.0.1 table 2
ip route add 172.16.0.0/24 dev eth1 table 2

# Setting Routing Rule to Access eth2 with Floating IP 
ip rule add from 10.254.0.90/32 table 3 priority 300
ip route add default via 10.254.0.1 table 3
ip route add 10.254.0.0/24 dev eth2 table 3
```
Then, you can find the routing rule set as below. 

``` 
$ ip rule													
0:	from all lookup local
200:	from 172.16.0.37 lookup 2 	
300:	from 10.254.0.90 lookup 3 	
32766:	from all lookup main
32767:	from all lookup default

$ ip route show table 2					
default via 172.16.0.1 dev eth1
172.16.0.0/24 dev eth1  scope link

$ ip route show table 3
default via 10.254.0.1 dev eth2
10.254.0.0/24 dev eth2  scope link
```

Since the routing rule setting returns to default along with instance rebooting, it is recommended to set auto routing rule when an instance is rebooted. 

## Security Group 

Security group is used to protect instances from other traffic. In general, "Positive Security Model" is applied to allow specified traffic, while blocking the others. 

With a service initiated, a default security group is created, blocking all inbound traffic. As a result, services like 'ping' or 'ssh' become available only by setting rules that are required. Same can be applied both to external access using floating IP and internal access using private IP. 

Many security groups can be set for an instance. When additional security group is created, with many rules added and set for an instance, all rules set for security groups shall be applied to the instance.   

For instance, if a security group called 'CONN' has rules named 'Ingress TCP PORT 22' and 'Ingress TCP PORT 23', while a security group called 'WEB' has rules named 'Ingress TCP PORT 80' and 'Ingress TCP PORT 8080', the two security groups, 'CONN' and 'WEB', can be assigned to an instance and make the four rules all available.    


| Item        | Description                                                  |
| ----------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| Flow        | Ingress refers to an inbound flow to an instance. Egress refers to an outbound flow from an instance. |
| Ether Type  | Version of EtherType IP. IPv4 or IPv6 can be specified.      |
| IP Protocol | A particular protocol or all protocols can be specified. Other protocol '0' means 'Random', which allows all IP protocols.            |
| Port Range  | For L4 protocol, the port range can be specified.            |
| Remote      | Range of a security group or IP address can be specified. If the flow of a rule is 'Egress', the destination is remote. <br>If it is 'Ingress', the departure is remote. Traffic departure and destination is compared depending on the flow of a rule. <br>When a security group is specified, see if the IP belongs to instances of the specified security group. <br>When IP address or range is specified by selecting CIDR, see if the IP address or range is set. |
| Description | You may add description on the rule of security group.       |

Since a security group runs by 'stateful', sessions that are once connected with a rule are allowed even without rule of the opposite flow. 

For example, if the first packet of TCP 80 which directs toward an instance, has passed by the 'Ingress TCP PORT 80' rule, the transfer packet which starts from TCP 80 port of an instance shall not be blocked.  

Nevertheless, if a session is closed due to failure of incoming packet which is appropriate for a particular period rule, packets of the opposite direction are also blocked.   

Default security group has rules for all outbound traffic from an instance. Unless the rules are removed, all sessions starting from instances are allowed. 

* Specifying a range is more effective than adding rules one by one.

* Adding more rules may degrade performance. 

* Traffic under inappropriate session status may be blocked. 

* Asymmetric traffic that has different inflow from outflow may be blocked. 

* Rules not on the list may be defined to use. For more details, refer to [Well-known port](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_TCP_and_UDP_port_numbers). 




## Routing Table 

A routing table is created along with VPC, and is also deleted along with a deletion of VPC. Many of them can be created within a VPC, and they may be deleted if not a default routing table. Subnets must be connected to at least one routing table, and multiple routing tables cannot share an internet gateway.   

When a list of routing table is designated, summary information is displayed on the screen of details, and more routes may be added by using "Routes". 

> [Note]
Adding more routes is available, only when available areas within VPC are designated. Otherwise, message will show failure. 

* Gateways of subnets included to a routing table are automatically added.  

* “Default routing table” cannot be deleted. It shall be deleted along with VPC on its deletion.

* Gateways of subnets and internet cannot be deleted from the list of routers. 

* Disconnecting a routing table from the internet gateway will disconnect the internet. 



## Peering 

Peering refers to connecting two different VPCs. In general, VPCs cannot communicate as their network areas are different, and may be linked via floating IPs but charged further depending on the network usage. Hence, peering is provided to communicate two VPCs 

> [Note] Peering connects two different VPCs; does not support a connection to a third VPC through another VPC. That is, for A <-> B <-> C, A and C cannot be linked.  

* Cannot use overlapped IP address areas of two VPCs.<br>When IP address areas of two VPCs to create peering are redundant, peering fails. 
* Size of an IP address area does not matter and communication with unlinked subnets to "default routing table" is unavailable. 
  * 한국(평촌) 리전은 피어링을 생성한 후, 피어링한 양쪽 VPC의 라우팅 테이블에 별도의 라우트를 설정해야 통신이 가능합니다.
    * 라우트의 "대상 CIDR"에 상대 VPC의 IP 주소 영역을 입력하고, "게이트웨이" 목록에서 피어링의 이름을 갖는 "PEERING" 항목을 선택하여 라우트를 추가합니다.
    * 라우트를 추가한 라우팅 테이블에 연결된 서브넷으로만 통신이 가능합니다.
* Peering is charged from the moment it is created. 
* There's no quota limits for a peering, but a subnet quota is required. 
  * 한국(평촌) 리전은 서브넷 쿼터를 사용하지 않고 피어링된 두 VPC 내에서 IP 1개씩을 사용합니다.



## 코로케이션 게이트웨이

코로케이션 게이트웨이는 TOAST에서 하이브리드로 제공하는 고객의 네트워크를 연결하기 위한 기능이며 한국(평촌) 리전에만 제공됩니다. TOAST에서 하이브리드 서비스를 사용하는 경우에 한정하여 TOAST Zone이 제공되고, 코로케이션 게이트웨이를 이용하여 구성한 VPC에 TOAST Zone을 직접 연결할 수 있습니다.

* 한 개의 VPC는 한 개의 TOAST Zone과 1:1로 연결됩니다.
* 연결과 동시에 과금됩니다.
